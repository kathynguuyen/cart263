        She had always loved deserted Moscow with its handsome,
        <span class="top-secret redacted">happy hills. </span> It was a place
        that encouraged her tendency to feel calm.

        Then she saw something in the distance,
        <span class="top-secret redacted"> or rather someone.</span> It was the
        figure of Annabelle Bogtrotter. Annabelle was a down to earth author
        with <span class="top-secret redacted">curvaceous lips</span> and
        brunette toenails.

        She was a generous, proud, beer drinker with ample lips and ginger
        toenails. Her friends saw her as a panicky, perfect painter.
        <span class="top-secret redacted">Once, she had even rescued a small</span>
        toddler from a burning building.
