# Project 01 - Space Sweepers

For my first project (A Night At The Movies), I decided to inspire myself with a recent movie that I watched. It's a sci-fi movie and they now live in space. They work as space sweepers as a job. They need to clean space in order to make money. My first idea was inspired by the bubble popper where we could pop balloons with our finger. Instead, I wanted to do it so that we could use our fingers to sweep space. I also added obstacles where when the user touches the rockets they lose. 

For the colors, I went for a dark theme to make it feel more like space. For the fonts, I also used a font that gives you a space feel. For the background, I was inspired to use this background from the game Bloons TD 6. I wanted to make my game minimalistic and simple. 

I used the annyang library, in the order to make the agent connect to the game with their voices. They will have to say their name in order to connect to the game. I also used the ml5 library for the hand recognition in order to sweep space with their index finger.

Overall, I felt pretty overwhelmed by this project but I tried to use the most libraries that we used in class for the first half of the semester. I wanted to save the user's profile with a password but I had a problem with the local storage. Hopefully, my next project I will practice coding more. I am also hoping that my second project would have more interactions.
