# Project 2 - Alice in Borderlands

This is a game inspired by the tv show Alice in Borderlands. The main concept I wanted to follow for this game is making a sort of escape room of riddles and running against the timer. I mainly used p5.js for the whole project and used libraries like ResponsiveVoice (for the instructions of the game master) and ml5.js (object detector for the last escape room). I changed some games from the prototype, because I was running out of time and I didn't know how to integrate JQuery and p5.js together. 

## First escape room:

- User has three doors
- They need to remember the sequence the game master is saying

## Second escape room:
- Listen to the word carefully
- Type it backwards as fast as possible in the input box

## Third escape room: 
- Turn on your camera
- Find the object demanded by the game master as fast as possible to escape the game.
